# Step 1: Ask

 In this step, we define the problem and objectives of our case study and its desired outcome.

#### 1.0 Background

> Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of beautifully-designed health-focused smart products for women since 2013. Inspiring and empowering women with knowledge about  >their own health and habits, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for females.
>
> The co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, Urška Sršen is confident that an analysis of non-Bellebeat consumer data (ie. FitBit fitness tracker usage data) would reveal more opportunities for growth.

#### 1.2 Business Task:

 Analyze FitBit fitness tracker data to gain insights into how consumers are using the FitBit app and discover trends for Bellabeat marketing strategy.

#### 1.3 Business Objectives:

* What are the trends identified?

* How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
 
* How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

#### 1.4 Deliverables:

* A clear summary of the business task

* A description of all data sources used

*Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data

*A summary of analysis

* Supporting visualizations and key findings

* High-level content recommendations based on the analysis

* 1.5 Key Stakeholders:

* Urška Sršen: Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer

* Sando Mur: Mathematician, Bellabeat’s cofounder and key member of the Bellabeat executive team

* Bellabeat marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts guiding Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

# STEP 2: PREPARE

 In the Prepare phase, we identify the data being used and its limitations.

#### 2.1 Information on Data Source:

* Data is publicly available on Kaggle: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data and stored in 18 csv files.

* Generated by respondents from a survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 12 March 2016 to 12 May 2016.

*  30 FitBit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data.
 
* Data collected includes physical activity recorded in minutes, heart rate, sleep monitoring, daily activity and steps.

#### 2.2 Limitations of Data Set:

* Data is collected 5 years ago in 2016. Users’ daily activity, fitness and sleeping habits, diet and food consumption may have changed since then. Data may not be timely or relevant.

* Sample size of 30 FitBit users is not representative of the entire fitness population.

* As data is collected in a survey, we are unable to ascertain its integrity or accuracy.

#### 2.3 Is Data ROCCC?

A good data source is ROCCC which stands for Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited.

> Reliable — LOW — Not reliable as it only has 30 respondents
>
> Original — LOW — Third party provider (Amazon Mechanical Turk)
>
> Comprehensive — MED — Parameters match most of Bellabeat products’ parameters
>
> Current — LOW — Data is 5 years old and may not be relevant
>
> Cited — LOW — Data collected from third party, hence unknown
>
> Overall, the dataset is considered bad quality data and it is not recommended to produce business recommendations based on this data.

# Step 3: Process Data From Dirty To clean 

#### 3.1 Tools
   We are using Mysql for data cleaning, transformation and creating Queries and Excel for data Visualization

#### 3.2 Cleaning The Data
   
![Image](images/cleaning%20image.jpg)

Import 3 files into MySQL Workbench

**1)** dailyActivity_merged.csv

**2)** sleepDay_merged.csv

**3)** weightLogInfo_merged.csv

#### 3.3Process

> Explore and observe data 
>
> Check for and treat missing or null values
>
> Transform data — format data type.
>
> Create queries for Visualizations.


#### 3.4 Data cleaning and manipulation

> Observe and familiarize with data
>
> Check for null or missing values
>
> Perform sanity check of data

# STEP 4: ANALYSE

![Images](images/images.jpg)

Create Differnt Query tables tp perform Analysis on Excel

* Perform calculations
 Pulling statistics for analysis:

* count — no. of rows

* mean (average)
 
* std (standard deviation)
 
* min and max

* percentiles 25%, 50%, 75%

# Art Of Visualizing Data

Like Bellabeat makes smart technology designed to track, contextualize, and present personal health data to their users in a comprehensible manner. FitBit/Bellabeat Leaf wearers use this data to improve their health, so it makes sense to analyze usage to identify the healthy (and unhealthy) tendencies shown in the data. Primarily, I’ll be looking at sleep, calories, and steps/activity.

###Sleep
![Images](viz%20Images/1.png)
                                  Recommended sleep per night is 7 hours or more according to the CDC


![Images](viz%20Images/2.png)
                                  Sedentary minutes had the strongest linear relationship to how much sleep users got per night


![Images](viz%20Images/3.png)
                                  At an R² value of roughly 0.04, it’s unclear what if any effect daily steps had on sleep


![Images](viz%20Images/4.png)
                                  Participants spent the most time awake in bed on Sunday nights


![Images](viz%20Images/5.png)
                                  Out of the four levels of activity, fairly active minutes seemed to have the biggest effect on how long it took to fall asleep.                                                       However, at an R² value of only 0.103, it can’t be deemed a strong determining factor


![Images](viz%20Images/6.png)
                                  It’s unclear what if any effect total steps had on how long it took to fall asleep each night


![Images](viz%20Images/7.png)
                                  Sleep was less frequently recorded on weekdays, particularly in the middle of the week


### Calories


![Images](viz%20Images/8.png)
                                 Overall, average calorie expenditure didn’t vary much by day of the week. The difference between the highest and lowest average was                                                           166 calories, about the same as a small handful of almonds
                          
                          
![Images](viz%20Images/9.png)
                                 Very active minutes had the strongest effect on daily caloric expenditure


![Images](viz%20Images/10.png)
                                 Total daily steps also had a moderately strong effect on caloric expenditure


![Images](viz%20Images/11.png)
                                 Hours slept had little to no effect on calories burned the next day; similarly, calories burned had little to no effect on how many                                                             hours were slept that same night


![Images](viz%20Images/12.png)
                               
Between the three subgroups of daily active distances, distances traveled while very active (which FitBit calculates using the wearer’s                                               heart rate) showed the strongest linear relationship to caloric expenditure



#### Steps/Activity



![Images](viz%20Images/13.png)
                                         Average daily steps was under the recommended amount of 10,000 for every day of the week
                                         

![Images](viz%20Images/14.png)
                                        Both the highest and lowest average occurred on the weekend
                                        

![Images](viz%20Images/15.png)
                                         Sedentary activity, notably bad for your health, accounted for a vast majority of participants’ time
