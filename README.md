# Step 1: Ask

In this step, we define the problem and objectives of our case study and its desired outcome.

#### 1.0 Background

> Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of beautifully-designed health-focused smart products for women since 2013. Inspiring and empowering women with knowledge about  >their own health and habits, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for females.
>
> The co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, Urška Sršen is confident that an analysis of non-Bellebeat consumer data (ie. FitBit fitness tracker usage data) would reveal more opportunities for growth.

#### 1.2 Business Task:

Analyze FitBit fitness tracker data to gain insights into how consumers are using the FitBit app and discover trends for Bellabeat marketing strategy.

#### 1.3 Business Objectives:

* What are the trends identified?

* How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
 
* How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

#### 1.4 Deliverables:

* A clear summary of the business task

* A description of all data sources used

*Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data

*A summary of analysis

* Supporting visualizations and key findings

* High-level content recommendations based on the analysis

* 1.5 Key Stakeholders:

* Urška Sršen: Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer

* Sando Mur: Mathematician, Bellabeat’s cofounder and key member of the Bellabeat executive team

* Bellabeat marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts guiding Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

# STEP 2: PREPARE

In the Prepare phase, we identify the data being used and its limitations.

#### 2.1 Information on Data Source:

* Data is publicly available on Kaggle: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data and stored in 18 csv files.

* Generated by respondents from a survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 12 March 2016 to 12 May 2016.

*  30 FitBit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data.
 
* Data collected includes physical activity recorded in minutes, heart rate, sleep monitoring, daily activity and steps.

#### 2.2 Limitations of Data Set:

* Data is collected 5 years ago in 2016. Users’ daily activity, fitness and sleeping habits, diet and food consumption may have changed since then. Data may not be timely or relevant.

* Sample size of 30 FitBit users is not representative of the entire fitness population.

*As data is collected in a survey, we are unable to ascertain its integrity or accuracy.

#### 2.3 Is Data ROCCC?

A good data source is ROCCC which stands for Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited.

> Reliable — LOW — Not reliable as it only has 30 respondents
>
> Original — LOW — Third party provider (Amazon Mechanical Turk)
>
> Comprehensive — MED — Parameters match most of Bellabeat products’ parameters
>
> Current — LOW — Data is 5 years old and may not be relevant
>
> Cited — LOW — Data collected from third party, hence unknown
>
> Overall, the dataset is considered bad quality data and it is not recommended to produce business recommendations based on this data.

# Step 3: Process Data From Dirty To clean 

#### 3.1 Tools
   We are using Mysql for data cleaning, transformation and creating Queries and Excel for data Visualization

#### 3.2 Cleaning The Data

* Consistency: To start, I identified the standard character length for each user ID (10). Across all tables, there were no deviations from this and/or incorrect   inputs.

* Duplicates: I found and deleted 3 duplicate rows total, all in the SleepLog table.

* Ambiguity: No metadata is available to confirm what metric is being used in the distance columns of the DailyActivity table. However, using a Steps-to-Distance chart from the University of Wyoming, I was able to calculate the approximate miles and kilometers corresponding to all steps in the dataset and compare each approximation to the recorded distances. The average approximate distance in kilometers was roughly four times closer to the average distance in the dataset than the average approximate distance in miles.

* Misleading records: Several records in the dataset reported a total of zero daily steps. While technically possible that these records reflect days that participants were wholly inactive—most of the same records also claim 24 hours of sedentary activity—they’re more likely reflective of days the users didn’t wear their FitBits, making the values potentially misleading. As a result, these records were deleted from the dataset.

* Outliers: Five records returned a daily calorie burn of less than 1,000 calories. This is unusual, since FitBit tracks caloric burn even while users are inactive and asleep using each person’s BMR. Because of how many calories are burned per day on average while a person is at rest, it’s highly unlikely that anyone burned less than 1,000 calories regardless of activity level. Furthermore, each of these five records were reported on the final day of the study (which varied for some participants; not everyone completed the 30-day period). Considered together, it’s possible that the values in these records don’t represent the results of the entire day. In this case, instead of deleting the records, I replaced the value in the Calories column with the participant’s average throughout the study. This was done in Excel, not SQL.

Here, we will process the data by cleaning and ensuring that it is correct, relevant, complete and free of error and outlier by performing:
