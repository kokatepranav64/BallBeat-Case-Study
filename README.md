# Step 1: Ask

In this step, we define the problem and objectives of our case study and its desired outcome.

#### 1.0 Background

> Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of beautifully-designed health-focused smart products for women since 2013. Inspiring and empowering women with knowledge about  >their own health and habits, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for females.
>
> The co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, Urška Sršen is confident that an analysis of non-Bellebeat consumer data (ie. FitBit fitness tracker usage data) would reveal more opportunities for growth.

Analyze FitBit fitness tracker data to gain insights into how consumers are using the FitBit app and discover trends for Bellabeat marketing strategy.

#### 1.3 Business Objectives:

* What are the trends identified?

* How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
 
* How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

#### 1.4 Deliverables:

* A clear summary of the business task

# STEP 2: PREPARE

In the Prepare phase, we identify the data being used and its limitations.

#### 2.1 Information on Data Source:

* Data is publicly available on Kaggle: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data and stored in 18 csv files.

* Generated by respondents from a survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 12 March 2016 to 12 May 2016.

*  30 FitBit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data.
 
* Data collected includes physical activity recorded in minutes, heart rate, sleep monitoring, daily activity and steps.

#### 2.2 Limitations of Data Set:

* Data is collected 5 years ago in 2016. Users’ daily activity, fitness and sleeping habits, diet and food consumption may have changed since then. Data may not be timely or relevant.

* Sample size of 30 FitBit users is not representative of the entire fitness population.

*As data is collected in a survey, we are unable to ascertain its integrity or accuracy.

#### 2.3 Is Data ROCCC?

A good data source is ROCCC which stands for Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited.

> Reliable — LOW — Not reliable as it only has 30 respondents
>
> Original — LOW — Third party provider (Amazon Mechanical Turk)
>
> Comprehensive — MED — Parameters match most of Bellabeat products’ parameters
>
> Current — LOW — Data is 5 years old and may not be relevant
>
> Cited — LOW — Data collected from third party, hence unknown
>
> Overall, the dataset is considered bad quality data and it is not recommended to produce business recommendations based on this data.
